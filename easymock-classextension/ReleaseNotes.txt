Notes:
The biggest feature is the new IMockBuilder interface allowing to create partial mocks
was more easily. See the documentation and javadoc to know how it works. Due to this
new class, old methods for partial mocking are now deprecated and will be removed
in EasyMock 3

Also, Objenesis isn't embedded anymore. You will have to add it explicitly (or Maven
will do it for you if you do use Maven). This was done to give more flexibility.

Finally, two nice features to follow EasyMock. The jar is now an OSGi bundle and class
mocks are now serializable.

Changes:
    * Incorrectly wrapped exception returned when EasyMock methods receive a parameter that is not a mock
    * Stub exception causes NPE (2407137)
    * Move to Subversion
    * Build entirely with Maven
    * Objenesis not embedded anymore
    * Add OSGi header to manifest (2774873)
    * New IMockBuilder interface to easily perform partial mocking (2822905, 2788098, 2783949)
    * Class mocks are now serializable (1963458)
