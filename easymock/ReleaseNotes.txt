Release Notes - EasyMock - Version 3.1

This release is mainly a bug fix release. It solves a series of long standing issues. 

It is fully compatible with version 3.0 but capture methods of primitive types were deprecated
and renamed to solve compilation issues. The deprecated methods will be removed from the next
EasyMock version.
