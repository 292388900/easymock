Notes:

EasyMock is now able to merge classes by itself.
Deprecated code from EasyMock 1 was removed.

If you don't perform class mocking, you can remove cglib and objenesis from your dependencies.

Migrating to EasyMock 3 should be painless. A deprecated class extension jar is available. So everything should
work like before. To get rid of the class extension, just remove the ".classextension" part in all your imports.

This new code base should allow quicker developments.

Changes:
    * Merge EasyMock and EasyMock Class Extension (2325762)
    * Add "boolean capture(...)" for completude (but I don't think it's useful)
    * Can't answer by delegating to a protected method (2891256)
    * Failure during recording phase can impact following tests (2914683)
    * Return a specific error when null is recorded as return value on a method returning a primitive type (2936175)
    * Can disable class mocking with EasyMock.DISABLE_CLASS_MOCKING
    * Remove deprecated classes from EasyMock 1
    * Should not fail on a mock not having a toString method (2937916)
    * Improved error message when matchers are mixed with raw params during method recording (2860190)
    * Check there are still results available in a recorded behaviour before trying to match with it (2940400)
    * Allow to mock classes from an Eclipse plugin (2994002)
    * Add isNull(Class<T>), notNull(Class<T>) and anyObject(Class<T>) for easier generic handling (2958636)
