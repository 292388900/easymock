Notes:
A bug was preventing to capture parameters from a stub.

A new EasyMockSupport class was added to help manipulating all mocks used in
a test case. See the SupportTest sample for an example.

Changes:
    * Can capture parameters from stubbed methods (2807921)
    * Add an EasyMockSupport to replayAll, verifyAll, etc. (2157782)
