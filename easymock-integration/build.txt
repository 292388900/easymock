I'm using:
- Eclipse 3.5.1
- Maven 2.2.1

To compile EasyMock Integration in Eclipse:
- In the base directory do "mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true"
- Import the newly created Eclipse project to your Eclipse workspace
- For the project to compile, you need to have a classpath variable named M2_REPO set to you maven repository directory.
  Two ways to set it:
  - Manually (Windows->Preferences->Classpath variables)
  - Calling "mvn eclipse:configure-workspace -Declipse.workspace=path/to/your/eclipse/workspace" (Eclipse must be closed)

To build EasyMock Integration with Maven:
- Type "mvn package", "mvn verify" or "mvn install"

To check-in:
- easymock/trunk/svn-config.txt should be used to handle mime types correctly
